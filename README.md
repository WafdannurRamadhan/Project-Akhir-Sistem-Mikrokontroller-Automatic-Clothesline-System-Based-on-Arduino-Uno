# Automatic-Clothesline-System-Based-on-Arduino-Uno

## Introductionin 
This project we designed and implemented the system architecture, integrating sensors with Arduino Uno to create an automatic clothesline by detecting falling rainfall and a system that can measure the amount of sunlight conversion.

# System Specifications
  Micrcontroller : Arduino Uno.
  
  Components     : Rain Drop Sensor, LDR Sensor, DC Motor, DC Motor Driver, Jumper, LCD
                   
# Working Principles
Arduino Uno controls various I/O, the rain sensor will detect rainfall, when it rains the system will move the clothesline inside using a DC motor so that clothes don't get wet and likewise the LDR sensor will detect the amount of light conversion, when the light conditions are dark then the clothesline will still be pulled in. 

# Installation and Setup
  1. Hardware Setup
     - Connect the Arduino Uno to Rain Drop Sensor, LDR Sensor, LCD, DC Motor, DC Motor Driver.
     
  3. Software Setup
     - Install the Arduino IDE
     - Upload the Arduino code that has been created according to your needs to the Arduino Uno.
